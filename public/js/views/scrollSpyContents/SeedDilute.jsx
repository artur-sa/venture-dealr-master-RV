          The prototype was a hit and you've convinced investors to give you seed money.  Nothing comes for free, and
          the price of the investment money is giving away a percentage of your company. Here, then, is our first
          encounter with <b>dilution</b>.  Figuring out how much you get diluted &mdash; how much of the company you have
          given away &mdash; is straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your investors look at what your company consists of today and assign it a value:
          the <span className="highlight-round-valuation"><strong>pre-money</strong></span> valuation. <span className="highlight-round-money">Their percentage stake</span> is
          how much they put in relative to the pre-money valuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dilution happens because investors get new shares created out of thin air.
          They increase the size of the pie, making your original shares a smaller piece of a larger pie.

            Not all shares are created equal. Investors are generally given <strong>preferred stock</strong> (shown here
            with teal bars), while employees and founders are generally given <strong>common stock</strong> (shown here
            with red/brown bars). The distinction becomes important in exit events &mdash; as we will see at the end of our
            journey, the pie will not be split evenly.
